# About me

<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a Physical Oceanographer interested in the dynamics, changes, and atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions in the polar regions. Currently, I work as an Ice/Ocean Modeller at the British Antarctic Survey on the GIANT project contributing to a better understanding of how Greenland’s glaciers are melting. I studied at GEOMAR, Germany and received my PhD from the University of New South Wales, Australia in 2025 where I investigated Antarctic Bottom Water formation and dynamics in a changing climate. </p>
  
<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am passionate about science communication as I enjoy sharing my knowledge and excitement for the oceans with students and the general public. You can find articles and podcasts <a href="https://schmidt-christina.github.io/media/">here</a>. </p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>  Please contact me at christina.schmidt@bas.ac.uk if you wish to know more or have any other questions. </p>
