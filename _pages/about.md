I am a Physical Oceanographer interested in what drives the ocean’s circulation from small to large scales and how this affects the climate system. In particular, the dynamics and processes on the Antarctic margin and in the Southern Ocean are fascinating to me. I use advanced technical skills, high-resolution ocean-sea ice models and Lagrangian methods to better understand changes in the ocean’s circulation.
